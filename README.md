I'm trying to get off of my VPS, which means moving my self-hosted stuff onto Heroku. I own a _lot_ of domains that are currently idle, so this is a catch-all for them.

It's currently set up for:

```
[{~/Github/generic-heroku} <2.0.0@generic-heroku> (master) ⚡] ➔ heroku domains
=== shielded-tundra-1656 Domain Names
shielded-tundra-1656.herokuapp.com
www.beekl.es
www.cruft.co
www.heyre.be
www.param3.com
```
